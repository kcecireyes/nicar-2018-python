The written agreement for care and services that RV entered into with RP1 was also dated January 17, 2013. The private pay contract indicated that RV would pay RP1 $4,000.00 per month. It also stated that RV would pay a one-time refundable deposit of $2,000.00. RV_x001A_s bank records verified that he/she had written a check on January 16, 2013 which satisfied the total move-in amount of $6,000.00 as agreed upon between RV and RP1. Additionally, RV also dispensed $950.00 to RP1. A notation on the check indicated that the $950.00 was for additional care to be provided by RP2. During the complaint investigation, Witness #4 (W4) reported that RP2 occasionally assisted other residents during the hours RP2 was being paid to provide care to RV. RP2 acknowledged that he/she had helped other residents but it was only a few times.



Based on RV_x001A_s bank records, RV paid $2,500.00 per month for care provided by RP2. With the exception of the check written to RP1 on January 16, 2013, the remainder of the checks were written directly to RP2. RP2 acknowledged there was no written contact between RV and RP2. 



As part of the investigation, adult protective services also reviewed RV_x001A_s care records. A medical assessment dated January 24, 2013 documented that RV was diagnosed with progressive dementia. Hospice staff who monitored RV_x001A_s condition maintained care narratives. A number of entries made by hospice staff from February 1, 2013 through September 27, 2013 indicated that RV often answered questions in a _x001A_nonsensical_x001A_ manner, used jumbled or incoherent words and disjointed sentences. Witness #1 (W1), Witness #2 (W2), Witness #3 (W3), W4, Witness #5 (W5) and Witness #6 (W6) all reported that RV_x001A_s cognition was highly impaired. W3 also reported that he/she had specifically suggested to RP1 that she contact an independent company to become a conservator for RV. 



During the course of the investigation, W2, W3, W5, and W6 all reported that RP1 had mentioned throughout the months that RP1 and RP2 had experienced difficulty with RV not writing checks to them. RP1 and RP2 acknowledged that they began to have RV sign several blank checks at a time. RP1 reported that she would put the checks in front of RV and guide h/h hand to the signature line and he/she would sign them. RP1 stated that she would fill in the amounts as his/her payments became due.



On the day RV died, there were two checks written from RV_x001A_s banking account. One check was written to RP1 in the amount of $2,000.00. A second check in the amount of $2,000.00 was written to RP2. RP1 reported that the checks had been written in the morning before RV died. However, hospice notes for October 2, 2013 indicated that _x001A_Pt [patient was] lying in bed and unresponsive_x001A_unable to swallow so AM tablet medications were not administered_x001A__x001A_ RP2 acknowledged to the investigator that the two checks written on October 2, 2013 had been completed using blank checks that RV had signed several weeks earlier.



Based on the prior payments RV made to Licensee since he/she admitted to Licensee_x001A_s AFH thru RV_x001A_s death on October 2, 2013, Licensee had received payment for services thru October 16, 2013. The section in the private pay contract which provided that the provider would receive 15 days payment after the death of the resident would have been approximately satisfied by the pre-payment for services from October 2, 2013 thru October 16, 2013 during which no services were provided. Additionally, the provider had received a one-time refundable deposit in the amount of $2,000.00 when the resident admitted to Licensee_x001A_s AFH. The additional $2,000.00 check completed on October 2, 2013 meant that the Licensee had received approximately $4,000.00 more than what the terms of the contract allowed. 



During the course of the investigation, adult protective services also reviewed RV_x001A_s payment history to RP2. The investigator determined that RV pre-paid for RP2_x001A_s monthly services. The check written to RP2 on September 3, 2013 would have been for anticipated services provided thru October 2, 2013. RP2 had been paid in full when RV died on October 2, 2013. The check completed for $2,000.00 on or about October 2, 2015 was for services not yet provided, thus not owed to RP2.

Documentation from Licensee_x001A_s screening and assessment of RV1 includes Licensee_x001A_s knowledge of RV1_x001A_s diagnosis of cognitive impairment. 



RV1 admitted to Licensee_x001A_s adult foster home (AFH) on or about March 6, 2013. RV1 whose diagnosis of cognitive impairment was known to the Licensee signed a private pay contract on March 6, 2013. Witness #4 (W4) reported that AFH staff also knew that RV1 had a cognitive impairment when he/she moved into the AFH.



The written agreement that RV1 entered into with the Licensee on March 6, 2013 was based on a standard rate of $3,500.00 per month with no add-on services. In March 2013 RV1 was billed for the dates of March 4, 2013 through March 31, 2013 which included two days prior to RV1_x001A_s arrival to Licensee_x001A_s AFH. 



On or about March 10, 2013, four days after RV1 signed the original contract, Licensee increased the rate. The letter of rate increase mentioned a per day rate of $175.00 instead of the monthly rate agreed to on March 6, 2013. No updated contract was prepared by the Licensee. No signature of agreement was obtained from RV1 or RV1_x001A_s designee.



The billing statement for April 2013 included add-on services valued at $450.00. RV1 was also invoiced $151.98 for miscellaneous items. No documentation of the extra charges was provided to RV1 or RV1_x001A_s designee(s).



The billing statement for May 2013 included add-ons totaling $1,750.00, $475.00 for incontinence of bladder, $575.00 for incontinence of bowel, and $700.00 for extra night care staff due to wandering. Additionally, the invoice billed RV1 for miscellaneous items totaling $168.00. A new contract was not signed by RV1_x001A_s power of attorney until May 11, 2013. The contract included a statement that when extra services were no longer needed, the amount of add-ons would be reduced.



Witness #1 (W1) reported that in the following months there were add-ons to the standard rate which exceeded the agreed upon monthly total of $5,250.00. When RV1_x001A_s long-term care insurance began paying for RV1_x001A_s care, the contract was written for $5,250.00 per month but the Licensee began charging $5,425.00. The difference was invoiced to RV1. W1 further reported that the Licensee increased the daily rate from $175.00 to $185.00. Witness #2 (W2) also reported that the Licensee failed to provide an itemized breakdown of any of the expenses when requested by RV1_x001A_s designee(s).

Witness #5 (W5) reported that RV1 was incontinent of bladder only half of the time when RV1 was placed on a routine bathroom schedule and he/she dad not experienced a bowel movement in which he/she did not use the bathroom. W5 stated that he/she had not observed any exit seeking behaviors and slept through the night.



The last invoice that was issued prior to RV1 moving from Licensee_x001A_s AFH was for $5,700.00. No written notice was given to RV1 or RV1_x001A_s designee 30 days prior to the rate increase. 



On or about March 19, 2014, RV1 moved out of Licensee_x001A_s AFH due to multiple occasions when Licensee failed to give written notification to RV1/RV1_x001A_s designee 30 days in advance of rate changes, failed to provide itemized breakdown of miscellaneous supplies and failed to amend the private pay contract and obtain an authorized signature of agreement whenever any element of the contract changed. 



W1 also reported that RV1_x001A_s incontinent supplies were missing when RV1 moved out of the AFH and Witness #6 (W6) confirmed that no incontinent supplies were sent with RV1 when he/she arrived at his/her new facility. 



Licensee billed RV1/RV1_x001A_s representative for 21 days as Licensee was not given a 30-day move-out notice.

Witness #4 (W4) remembered that a health provider mentioned a hoyer lift for RV1 last year and W4 stated that the facility would have used it but it was never ordered so W4 figured it wasn_x001A_t needed.



RV1_x001A_s facility progress note and home health agency note dated February 8, 2014, indicated that home health had visited with RV1 that day. It was identified that RV1 had pressure sores on his/her sacrum and both heels. The facility stated that they will keep him/her off of his/her back at all times and keep RV1_x001A_s heels off the bed using pressure relieving boots. A facility incident report also dated February 8, 2014 noted that during a transfer RV1 started yelling in pain and he/she was set down on the floor. The facility had to call 911 who dispatched emergency medical technicians to the AFH to put RV1 back in his/her bed. A home health agency note dated February 13, 2014 documented that the wound on RV1_x001A_s buttocks was now open.



A supplemental order issued by home health on March 4, 2014 stated that the sacral ischial wound was at least a stage 3 with undermining and about 15% slough tissue at the base. Also on or about March 4, 2014, home health documented that RV1 needed two people to move him/her to reduce the friction on his/her wound and that RV1 should be lifted, not pulled. It was observed that there was only one caregiver on duty. 



Witness #1 (W1), Witness #2 (W2) and Witness #3 (W3) all reported that RV1 required two people to move him/her. The AFH was staffed with only one person per shift and in the absence of sufficient staff to meet the care needs of RV1 staff would slide RV1 to position him/her. RV1 described that the staff on duty would _x001A_pull_x001A_ on RV1 underneath his/her armpits and slide him/her to where facility staff wanted him/her. W3 reported that the sore on RV1_x001A_s coccyx had worsened due to RV1 being _x001A_dragged_x001A_ during repositioning as this method caused friction and would not allow the coccyx wound to heal.  



RV1 had pressure relieving boots and W2 reported that he/she had shown the AFH staff how to use the boots. However, when RV1_x001A_s physical therapist visited the AFH on March 5, 2014, the boots were not being used properly and RV1 was lying on his/her coccyx wound. W3 also witnessed times when RV1_x001A_s boots had been put on incorrectly which caused RV1_x001A_s wounds to worsen. W3 further stated that RV1_x001A_s boots were not used everyday which RV1 confirmed. W1 reported that RV1_x001A_s heels have had sores on them for at least a year. RV1 reported that his/her heels hurt and that RV1 had not been able to put any pressure on them for months.



On or about March 7, 2014, home health identified a new stage one wound on RV1_x001A_s _x001A_left hip/upper butt area_x001A_. A reminder was given to the facility to turn RV1 every two hours with two people lifting him/her up in bed and _x001A_don_x001A_t drag_x001A_.



A facility progress note dated on or about March 8, 2014 reflected that RV1 had developed another red spot on his/her buttocks and was getting darker and _x001A_very concerning_x001A_.



During the course of the investigation that commenced on March 7, 2014, RV1_x001A_s latest care plan was reviewed. The care plan provided to the investigator was dated August 19, 2013. Care plans must be reviewed and updated every six months or as the resident_x001A_s condition changes. 



Licensee failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent the development and worsening of RV1_x001A_s wounds which caused RV1 unreasonable pain and discomfort for a prolonged period of time. Licensee failed to have sufficient staff to safely meet the 24-hour care needs of each resident. License failed to review and update RV1_x001A_s care plan every six months or as RV1_x001A_s condition changed.

The Adult Protective Services Specialist determined that Licensee (RP) maintained a strict routine in his adult foster home (AFH) and wanted everything completed in a certain manner. RP acknowledged that he can be stern but he also stated that he knows the best way to accomplish everything in an efficient manner and it was important that his schedule was followed.



Witness #1 (W1), Witness #3 (W3), Resident #1 (RV1) and Resident #5 (R5) all reported that RP had spoken to residents in an aggressive, rude and demanding manner. W3 also communicated that RP demonstrated little patience or tolerance when RP_x001A_s schedule was interrupted. RV1 stated that he/she would not activate RV1_x001A_s call button, even when RV1 needed assistance with his/her incontinent garment at night because RP had previously spoken meanly to him/her. RV1 reported that he/she felt scared and scolded, afraid of how RP would react when RP was awakened. RV5_x001A_s statements supported that RP did not like being awakened during the night. RV5 avoided asking RP for assistance because RP acted like it was an inconvenience. RP admitted to W3 and directly to APS that he can be a little short with residents.

Additionally, during the course of the investigation it was discovered that residents were directed to their rooms at 7:30pm. If residents did not want to go to bed, those that had televisions could watch TV in their rooms but must do it very quietly as RP did not like noise. RV1 and RV5 reported that residents had to remain in their rooms until RP came to get them up in the morning which was sometime between 7am and 8am. At that point, RP usually began assisting residents, in a specific order. RP acknowledged that 7am is still quiet time in the AFH. RV1 also reported that residents were transferred to their recliners at 10am which was also confirmed by RP.

Resident #1 (RV) was incontinent of bowel and bladder as documented in RV_x001A_s Resident Assessment completed by the Licensee on May 22, 2015. RV required assistance with mobility which was documented in both the Resident Assessment dated May 22, 2015 and RV_x001A_s Care Plan dated June 16, 2015. A nursing note entry made by home health dated June 30, 2015 indicated that RV required the assistance of 1-2 people for ambulation and transferring. RV also required wound care for a stage III pressure ulcer on RV_x001A_s sacrum. 



Due to RV_x001A_s incontinence and RV_x001A_s mobility concerns, Licensee acknowledged to the Adult Protective Services Specialist (APSS) that she had two rules for RV: (1) RV must not get out of his/her recliner and (2) RV must not remove his/her incontinent garments. RV confirmed to APSS that Licensee said he/she could not get out of his/her chair. RV further shared with APSS that RV felt like a prisoner. 



Licensee reported that RV constantly broke her two _x001A_rules_x001A_ and not remember so Licensee began taking photographs to prove the behavior to RV. During the investigation, Licensee showed a number of pictures to APSS. These pictures were often taken while RV was still on the floor, hanging over the recliner, on or around the toilet and in various stages of undress. In at least one case the pictures were sent to RV_x001A_s family. 



RP recounted a specific occurrence when she required the assistance of another person to lift RV off the floor. In that instance, Licensee left the AFH to ask a neighbor for help in getting the RV back into RV_x001A_s recliner.

RV further reported that he/she would hold his/her urine as long as possible. RV told the APSS that he/she would have to sit for long periods in his/her wet and soiled incontinent brief. A nursing note dated June 30, 2015, documented that home health was unable to locate a caregiver in the facility when RV needed toileting assistance. The home health staff assisted RV with his/her toileting needs. The caregiver was later found asleep in the AFH. 



Additionally, Witness #1 (W1) reported that RV had developed a yeast infection in the fold of skin on RV_x001A_s abdomen. RV had been prescribed a powder medication to treat the yeast infection but Licensee stopped applying the powder because it would cake up and roll down RV_x001A_s clothes. Licensee acknowledged to the Adult Protective Services Specialist (APSS) that she did not obtain an order from RV_x001A_s medical professional to discontinue the use of the medicated powder. Licensee also reported that instead of using the medicated powder, she began using a barrier cream without obtaining a physician_x001A_s order.

Resident #1 stated that he/she keeps a close eye on his/her wallet. The first loss was in the amount of $40.00 and the second loss was for $50.00. Resident #1 told the licensee (RP1) that he/she would not tell anyone about the missing cash because RP1 had reimbursed him/her. When interviewed, RP1 stated that she had replaced $20.00, not $90.00 and that it happened only one time.



Later Resident #1 identified that he/she was missing a fly tying kit. The kit was purchased for him/her by Witness #2 (W2) for approximately $50.00. 



During the course of the investigation, it was discovered that Reported Perpetrator #2 (RP2) had worked in licensee_x001A_s adult foster home (AFH). RP2 stated that he/she assisted people to bed, cleaned and cooked meals at the AFH.  Witness #4 (W4) reported that he/she understood that RP2 could not pass a background check. Witness #3 (W3) stated during his/her interview that RP1 had RP2 working in the facility on the weekends because RP1 knew that the State of Oregon didn_x001A_t inspect facilities on the weekend.



RP1 stated during her interview that RP2 did not work in the AFH but would come to the AFH and prepare breakfast and lunch [in approximately December of 2012] and that was it. RP1 further commented that any witnesses that said RP2 was working in RP1_x001A_s AFH were lying. RP1 also asserted that RP2 did not use the AFH as his/her address. 



Department records related to RP2 were reviewed by the investigator. A record dated April 5, 2012 and signed by RP2 listed the address of the AFH as RP2_x001A_s home address and the facility_x001A_s land line as RP2_x001A_s phone number. A second record dated October 24, 2012 and signed by RP2 listed the address of the AFH as RP2_x001A_s address and indicated _x001A_same_x001A_ in the space for his/her mailing address. A third record dated April 12, 2013 and signed by RP2 includes a statement by RP2 that _x001A_I live in a trailer next to [RP1]. I work 1 day for exchange of rent._x001A_ The investigator also verified judicial information that indicated RP2 had been convicted of a crime that would potentially disqualify RP2 from obtaining an approved background check.

After reconsidering the matter as directed by the court, the department issues this amended Letter of Determination. 

Resident #1 had a diagnosis related to cognition issues and had a care plan to deal with his/her occasionally combative behaviors. On or about October 1, 2011, RP2 physically harmed and was verbally inappropriate with Resident #1 after Resident #1 became combative when RP2 initiated resident personal care. RP2 asserts RP2 grabbed Resident #1's wrist to stop Resident #1 from physically striking RP2, causing skin discoloration and a skin tear to the resident in the process. 

Physical abuse is defined under OAR 411-020-0002(1)(a)(A) to include: (i) ""The use of physical force that may result in bodily injury, physical pain, or impairment or (ii) Any physical injury to an adult caused by other than accidental means."" Nowhere within this rule, or any other rule relating to the determination of abuse, is ""self defense"" specifically addressed. However, the department does examine the totality of circumstances when reviewing an incident to determine whether to substantiate a finding of abuse. 

In this case, RP2 knew that Resident #1 had a history of combative behavior, but failed to heed the resident's multiple requests to leave him/her alone. RP2 continued to engage with the resident, resulting in increased agitation and combative behavior by the resident. RP2's conduct was contrary to the resident's care plan. Although it may be that the resident became combative toward RP2, RP2 could have simply blocked the strikes from the resident. This altercation did not justify the use of any physical force to the resident. RP2 was not in imminent danger that might have required the use of physical force for the resident's safety or for the safety of others. RP2 had the ability to step away from the resident and be on standby mode if resident safety was a concern.  From that position, RP2 could have also continued to request assistance from other staff.  RP2 had multiple options to protect himself/herself from the resident's combative behavior without using physical force against the resident. Based upon the totality of the circumstances, RP2 was not justified in causing physical injury to Resident #1. Therefore, RP2 is substantiated for physical abuse. 

The facility was aware of RP2's inability to work with residents with combative behaviors. The facility failed to ensure a safe environment resulting in harm to Resident #1.
